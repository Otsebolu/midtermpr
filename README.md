MID TERM PROJECT

*Problem Statement:*

The United States is nowadays facing a huge problem with human resources. Finding the best talent is always a tough job for the human resources department. Companies in the USA are open to hiring highly skilled people both locally and internationally.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the United States allows foreign workers to come to the country to work on a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against adverse impacts on their wages or working conditions by ensuring all the safeguards mentioned in the act. Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) administers this act.

The OFLC (Office of Foreign Labor Certification) processed millions of applications for different positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. There is a percentage increase in the number of applications as compared to previous years. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants increases every year. With an increasing number of applicants each year, a machine learning-based solution that can assist in shortlisting candidates with a higher chance of VISA approval is required. EasyVisa has been hired by OFLC to provide data-driven solutions. As a data scientist at EasyVisa, you must analyze the data provided and, using a classification model, make the visa approval process easier.
